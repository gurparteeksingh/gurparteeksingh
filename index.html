			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p> I recently commenced my PhD in July 2020 at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) and I have been awarded Research Training Program (RTP) scholarship. I also recently graduated in March 2020 with double undergraduate degree in Bachelor of Engineering (ICT) and Bachelor of Business from UTS. I developed a strong interest in the field of Security and Machine Learning while I was studying engineering as I strongly believe that technology in the future will be dependent on machine learning.  My current research topic is evaluating and developing adversarial learning for validating the robustness of modern Artificial Intelligence systems. </p>
			<p> I have developed many skills while studying at UTS. I achieved high distinction in both of my Engineering Capstone (Honours) subjects. I worked on a project called CodeMap in my honours for 12 months. CodeMap is a web application that allows users to visualise their C or C++ GitHub repositories through an interactive graph. It could also be used for data analytics. The aim of the project was to help programmers understand the structure and relations of different modules through the interactive graph. The project was completed with another Engineering Honours student.	</p>
			<p> I have learnt Python, SQL, C++, Tableau, HTML, CSS and JavaScript using multiple online resources to continuously improve my technical skills. I genuinely enjoy learning on my own during my spare time. I always strive to continuously improve my technical skills due to the nature of fast changing technology. After I complete my PhD, my goal is to successfully develop into a researcher or academic so I can continue to make valuable contributions.</p>
